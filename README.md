## ✍️ About Me — Beyond Code

🌱 I love to **write in Tamil**, sharing thoughts, stories, and reflections whenever possible.  
📚 An avid reader of **non-fiction** and **literary fiction**, especially works from  
- **Latin American legends** like *Gabriel García Márquez* and *Mario Vargas Llosa*, and  
- **Tamil stalwarts** like *Ka. Na. Subramaniam* and *Charu Nivedita*.

Writing, coding, and problem-solving are all different forms of storytelling — and I enjoy practicing them all.
