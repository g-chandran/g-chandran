Hi, I'm @g-chandran. I'm a full-time Web Developer. Svelte and SvelteKit are my favorites, but React, NextJs, and Astro too have my attention. Django, FastAPI, and a few more are also in my backpack.

I believe I'm a world problem solver than a tech problem solver. So tech is only a tool for me to solve real-world problems. Currently building traders-fund with [achuth-noob](https://github.com/achuth-noob).

You can email me at chandranchan321@gmail.com for collabs. Soo excited to connect!
